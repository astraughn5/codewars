// Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

// For example:

// a = 1
// b = 4
// --> [1, 2, 3, 4]
//PREP
//P: integers, whole, could be + or -
//R: return array including a & b
//E:
function between(a, b) {
	// your code here
  }

between(1,4) //output [1,2,3,4]
between(0,3) //output [0,1,2,3]
between(-2,1) //output [-2,-1,0,1]
